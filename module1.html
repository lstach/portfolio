<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This website is where I will be putting things I am working on that I believe are worth sharing. Right now, it's just some basic HTML that needs to be spruced up, but this will do for the time being.
    (Recruiting season has me *very* busy!)
</p>

<p>Below, you'll see 3 images, which are the 3 visualizations I created for my first assignment in COMP 590: Visualization Design Methods.  There will be more 'techy' stuff in the future on this webpage, don't worry.</p>

<p>Thanks for looking in the meantime! -Logan</p>
